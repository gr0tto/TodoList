# ToDo App to learn React

Something I did just for myself in order to learn some React/js/CSS.

Based heavily on [the React tutorial](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html).

## How to start

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

And visit <http://localhost:3000/>.

## Limitations

Currently saves the todo-items in todoitems.json
